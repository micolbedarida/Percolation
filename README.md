# Percolation

This project was completed as part of the 1st year of my Physics degree at Imperial College London.

Percolation report.pdf Is the lab report I submitted which explains the purpose of the porject.

The main bit of code can be found in percolation.py, with further and more in-depth analyses in the other codes.
